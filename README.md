To run this app, there are two components:
1. The frontend
2. The backend

To start the Flask backend (just like before), cd into the 'flask' folder and run python3 server.py. This should start a Flask server on port 6001.

To start the React frontend, cd back into the root directory, and run:
1. yarn install
2. npm start
